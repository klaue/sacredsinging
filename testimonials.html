              <p class="mb-0">"I cannot say enough about Devotional Singing with Presence. This is music that will feed your soul. The really cool thing is that you get to co-create this happening as you sing along. I experienced this Musically Heart Expanding Experience a week ago and it made an indelible impression on me that is still vibrating in the core of my Being. This is an opportunity to treat yourself to something very special." <br><br>~ Samuel Kiwask, Culver City, CA

The amount of positive, healing energy felt flowing through the air was truly amazing. Feelings of sorrow, pain, and loss seemed to exit my body, replacing them were love, hope, and joy. The entire experience could only be described as enlightening. I believe Presence is an amazing person who has been blessed with a wonderful gift, and encourage all walks of life to attend her Devotional Singing.

I haven't been sleeping very well, but last night I slept soundly for six hours… and I know it had a lot to do with how I spent the earlier part of the evening!!! It was like taking a long bath in good vibes (positive energy)… soaking it up! Your voice is really beautiful in itself and you use it for the greater good! You channel Spirit! It was wonderful evening; lovely choices of songs, pacing, etc.! :) You were glowing… and you passed along your glow and healing and light to everyone who was in the room!!! Thank you!"
