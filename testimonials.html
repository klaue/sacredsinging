The really cool thing is that you get to co-create this happening as you sing along. I experienced this Musically Heart Expanding Experience a week ago and it made an indelible impression on me that is still vibrating in the core of my Being.

The amount of positive, healing energy felt flowing through the air was truly amazing! Feelings of sorrow, pain, and loss seemed to exit my body. Replacing them were love, hope, and joy. The entire experience could only be described as enlightening. I believe Presence is an amazing person who has been blessed with a wonderful gift, and encourage all walks of life to attend her Sacred Singing.
